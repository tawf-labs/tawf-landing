# Tawf.xyz

> **Shariah-Compliant Web3 Infrastructure for Verified Faith-Based Actions**

**Tawf.xyz is a Shariah-compliant Web3 dApp ecosystem** designed to bring Islamic finance, philanthropy, and governance on-chain in a **transparent, auditable, and privacy-preserving way**.

In simple terms: **Tawf is an Islamic Web3 infrastructure for verified faith-based actions** (zakat, waqf, qurban, donations, governance) using smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs.

---

## What is the Tawf Shariah dApp Ecosystem?

Tawf is **not a single app**, but an **ecosystem of interoperable decentralized applications (dApps)** that follow **Islamic (Shariah) principles** such as:

* No riba (interest)
* Asset-backed and purpose-driven funds
* Transparency and accountability
* Ethical governance and trust (amanah)

---

## Core Goals

1. **Faith-compliant Web3**

   * Muslims can participate in blockchain without compromising Shariah principles.

2. **Radical transparency**

   * Donations and funds are traceable on-chain.
   * Impact is verifiable, not just promised.

3. **Privacy by design**

   * Sensitive data (identity, eligibility, compliance) can be proven using **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs** without being publicly revealed.

---

## Main Components of the Ecosystem

### 1. **ZKT (Zakat / Infaq / Sadaqah / Waqf)**

* On-chain charitable giving
* Transparent fund flows
* Proof of distribution
* Optional ZK proofs for:

  * Eligibility
  * Compliance
  * Solvency

👉 Focus: **Trust + accountability in donations**

---

### 2. **QRBN.app (Qurban & Farm Financing)**

* On-chain qurban marketplace
* Shariah-compliant farm financing (wakaf / sukuk-like structures where allowed)
* NFT or on-chain proof for:

  * Animal existence
  * Slaughter fulfillment
  * Distribution

👉 Focus: **From intention (niyyah) to verified sacrifice**

---

### 3. **Waqf Infrastructure**

* Non-custodial waqf pools
* Funds locked by smart contracts
* Clear purpose and usage rules
* Long-term, sustainable impact

👉 Focus: **Perpetual charity with on-chain guarantees**

---

### 4. **Shariah Governance Layer**

* DAO-like governance with **Shariah constraints**
* Admin multisig for safety (early stage)
* Shariah council or reviewers as a protocol layer
* Future ZK-based compliance proofs

👉 Focus: **Decentralization without losing Islamic oversight**

---

### 5. **Proof Layer (ZK & NFTs)**

* NFTs as **non-transferable (soulbound)** proofs:

  * Donation proof
  * Qurban completion
  * Campaign participation
* IPFS for documents, reports, and evidence
* ZK proofs planned for:

  * Shariah compliance
  * Solvency
  * Eligibility

👉 Focus: **"Don't trust, verify — without exposing private data."**

---

## Why Tawf Matters

Most crypto:

* Is speculative
* Lacks real-world accountability
* Conflicts with Islamic finance principles

**Tawf flips the narrative**:

* Purpose over speculation
* Impact over hype
* Faith-aligned design from day one
